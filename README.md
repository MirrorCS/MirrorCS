Here's @MirrorCS, only another explorer in interest.
Just using github to upload and share my unuseful projects that I coded in the past.
Hopefully it'll leave a mark on the cyberspace?

Currently learning javascript.

Projects in progress:
- yywgenerator -
a project which basic function is to generate a conclusion page of the game "BanG Dream: Girls Band Party!".
it also includes functions of drawing cards, generate song lists and other functions.
Now working on its website js code.
